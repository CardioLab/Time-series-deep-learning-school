### What is this repository for? ###

Very basic introduction to Deep Learning in Matlab
The repository includes example for classification and regression using artificial signals such as sinus and saw-tooth signals



### How do I get set up? ###

The current repo use two approach for storge of signals, one as a cell Sequence and one as an Images. 
Run makeSignalsSawAndSine.m  to make both  Sequences and images signals contanin saw-tooth and sinus signals
